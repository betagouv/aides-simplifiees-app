# Plan: Security Improvements - CSP and Rate Limiting

## Date
Created: 2025-10-31

## Context
The application currently lacks important security features:
- No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- No input sanitization for user-generated content

These are critical security measures to protect against:
- XSS attacks (CSP)
- DDoS/brute force attacks (rate limiting)
- Code injection (input sanitization)

## Objectives
- [x] Implement Content Security Policy middleware
- [x] Add rate limiting to API endpoints
- [x] Create input sanitization utility
- [ ] Add tests for security features
- [ ] Update documentation (after user validation)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Content Security Policy ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Create CSP middleware (enabled in shield.ts)
2. [x] Configure CSP directives for app needs
3. [ ] Test CSP headers in development
4. [ ] Add unit tests

### Phase 2: Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Create throttle middleware with configurable limits
2. [x] Apply to API endpoints (OpenFisca, form submissions)
3. ⏸️ Add Redis support for distributed rate limiting (deferred - not needed for MVP)
4. [ ] Test rate limit behavior
5. [x] Add appropriate error responses

### Phase 3: Input Sanitization ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Add DOMPurify dependency
2. [x] Create sanitization utility
3. ⏸️ Apply to CMS content rendering (deferred - need to identify specific usage points)
4. [ ] Add unit tests

## Files to Create
- `app/middleware/csp_middleware.ts` - Content Security Policy
- `app/middleware/throttle_middleware.ts` - Rate limiting
- `app/utils/sanitize.ts` - Input sanitization
- `tests/unit/middleware/csp_middleware.spec.ts` - CSP tests
- `tests/unit/middleware/throttle_middleware.spec.ts` - Rate limit tests
- `tests/unit/utils/sanitize.spec.ts` - Sanitization tests

## Files to Modify
- `start/kernel.ts` - Register CSP middleware globally
- `start/routes.ts` - Apply throttle to API routes
- `config/shield.ts` - CSP configuration
- Templates using v-html - Apply sanitization

## Security Considerations
- CSP: Must allow inline styles/scripts only where necessary
- Rate limiting: Configure appropriate limits per endpoint
- Sanitization: Must preserve safe HTML while blocking XSS

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each middleware
- Integration tests for rate limiting behavior
- E2E tests to verify CSP doesn't break functionality
- Security audit with OWASP guidelines

## Documentation to Update
After user validation:
- `docs/domains/security.llm.txt` (new)
- `app/middleware/csp_middleware.llm.txt` (new)
- `app/middleware/throttle_middleware.llm.txt` (new)

## History
- 2025-10-31: Created plan file
- 2025-10-31: Completed Phase 1-3 implementation
  - Enabled CSP in shield.ts with appropriate directives
  - Created throttle_middleware.ts with configurable rate limiting
  - Created sanitize.ts utility with DOMPurify
  - Applied rate limiting to all API endpoints
  - Added limiter and isomorphic-dompurify dependencies
